					<p>How long does a dryer typically last? According to reviews from customers, it has a lifespan of 10 years. But maintenance your dryer in proper way it may extend the life of the device by 25 years. Tragically, 17% of dryer owners report problems during the first 5 years after purchasing the dryer.</p>
					<p>We all purchase household appliances with the expectation that they will endure a long time. It's inconvenient to have to fix your dryer on a frequent basis. It's much more frustrating if you've just purchased a new dryer.</p>
					<p>Learn 5 Tips from this post to maintain your dryer in top condition.</p>
					<h2>1. Adhere to Dryer Maintenance Guides</h2>
					<p>Manuals are your major resource for determining how to care for your dryer. The instructions include installation, maintenance, and load size recommendations. If this is your first time using the dryer, the instructions are excellent instructional tools. So, why are manuals required?</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>Maintains a consistent approach to the care of your device</li>
					<li>It instructs you on how to utilise a gadget to its full potential.</li>
					<li>Aids in the resolution of problems and replies</li>
					<li>Provides specific guidelines for operating and maintaining dryers</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The manuals are available online or in hard copy. This handbook assists you in avoiding damage or malfunction of your drying machine.</p>
					<h2>2. Avoid Putting Too Much Laundry on Your Dryer</h2>
					<p>Breakage is often caused by overloading the dryer. Every dryer has its own unique capacity. Find out your dryer's maximum and lowest limitations. Find out your dryer's maximum and lowest limitations. Do you know why it's harmful to overload the dryer?</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>Increases the amount of lint in the trap: Higher lint levels obstruct the free movement of air.</li>
					<li>Burn out is caused by overheating the dryer's motor: Overworking a machine by overloading it leads to overheating.</li>
					<li>The belt, pulley assembly, and spindle bearings are all harmed.</li>
					<li>Also, when you overfill the dryer, it takes longer to dry everything and consumes more electricity.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>By avoiding overloading your dryer, you may avoid an explosion and damage.</p>
					<h2>3. Thoroughly wash the lint and drum</h2>
					<p>Just because the dryer has a lint trap does not mean there is no lint. Lint accumulates in the dryer on a daily basis. If it builds up for too long, it may harm your dryer or possibly start a fire. How do you remove the lint out of your dryer?</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>At least twice a year, use a vacuum to clear the lint trap.</li>
					<li>Dry the space between the dryer's drum and its door with a vacuum.</li>
					<li>Make sure your home's outside vent is clean.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It's excellent to maintain the lint trap as thoroughly as possible. Inspect it as often as possible to ensure that it is clean. Keep the drying machine from becoming overloaded. It contributes to a high lint production.</p>
					<h2>4. Install New Ventilation Ducts</h2>
					<p>The vast majority of dryer vent ducts are composed of metal or plastic. The material is intended to provide flexibility in the replacement of vent ducts.</p>
					<p>Are there any extra fees for the ducts? The ducts are inexpensive and widely accessible. Furthermore, they are straightforward to set up. The main issue, though, is that they are not safe to use.</p>
					<p>The thin ducts are simple to break, and if they are made of plastic, they may even melt. Such difficulties lead to dryer overheating, which might harm the dryer.</p>
					<p>If the dryer heats up, the chance of starting a fire increases. According to research, washing machines are involved in 15,970 residential fires each year.</p>
					<p>So, how can you prevent such risks? Metal ducts should be used in lieu of flexible ducts.</p>
					<p>The following are indications that you should replace your ventilation ducts.</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>If the drying process continues to take too long</li>
					<li>When the clothes or dryer get too warm</li>
					<li>The dryer emits a burning odour.</li>
					<li>The vent flap tries desperately to open.</li>
					<li>If it has been more than a year since the last replacement</li>
					</ul>
					<p>To keep your ventilation duct from burning or breaking, replace and examine it on a regular basis. If, even replacing the ventilation duct, any of the difficulties described above persist, you should consider having it repaired.</p>
					<h2>5. Check the Dryer's Stability When Used</h2>
					<p>Dryers, like washers, may lose their stability. Instability may result from improper load distribution.</p>
					<p>If the dryer's utilization is often inconsistent, it might lead to the failure of certain dryer components. Why? Unstable dryer placement causes uneven wear on the machine.</p>
					<p>The issue is simple to resolve. How? You may shake your dryer to ensure even load distribution. Additionally, make sure your dryer is flat. If the dryer remains unsteady, you may add support beneath.</p>
					<p>Nota bene: The instructions might also instruct you on how to set the dryer to a more stable position.</p>
					<h3>Last Thoughts</h3>
					<p>Dryers have aided in the transition of life by allowing for faster washing operations and the preservation of your items. You wouldn't want to go back to beating your washing outside or spend extra money on a new dryer.</p>
					<p>Avoid overloads, close the vent gap, and clean the unit to ensure good dryer maintenance. It will assist to lengthen the life of the dryer.</p>
